        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Baklava is a delicious Greek dessert made up of layers of crispy phyllo dough, honey and nuts that's sooo easy to make. A Greek friend showed me how to make this fabulous recipe. </p>
        <p>Baklava is a traditional pastry known for its sweet, rich flavor and flaky texture. It consists of phyllo (or filo) dough, nuts, spices, and a sugary syrup.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package phyllo dough</li>
            <li>1 pound chopped nuts</li>
            <li>1 cup butter</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>half a cup of honey</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C). Butter the bottoms and sides of a 9x13-inch pan.</li>
            <li>Chop nuts and toss with cinnamon. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Unroll phyllo dough. Cut whole stack in half to fit pan. Cover phyllo with a dampened cloth to keep from drying out as you work. Place two sheets of dough in pan, butter thoroughly. Repeat until you have 8 sheets layered.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle 2 to 3 tablespoons of nut mixture on top. Top with two sheets of dough, butter, nuts, layering as you go. The top layer should be about 6 to 8 sheets deep.</li>
            <li>Using a sharp knife cut into diamond or square shapes all the way to the bottom of the pan. You may cut into 4 long rows then make diagonal cuts. Bake for about 50 minutes until baklava is golden and crisp.</li>
            <li>Make sauce while baklava is baking. Boil sugar and water until sugar is melted. Add vanilla and honey. Simmer for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove baklava from the oven and immediately spoon sauce over it. Let cool.</li>
            <li>Serve in cupcake papers. This freezes well. Leave it uncovered as it gets soggy if it is wrapped up.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
